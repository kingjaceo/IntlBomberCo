It is 1 AM. I have worked for 10-14 hours. I accomplished:
- Improved InventoryDisplay using ItemSlots and ItemIcons and GameData
- "dynamic" camera zooming based on locale
- "Dock" view for the Town Screen, showing ship inventory
- DeliveredTrigger, which allows arbitrary item delivery contracts to arbitrary locations.
Next steps:
- DONE: a way to "evolve" the offered contracts, perhaps based on accumulated reputation (need: ReputationReward to modify player Reputation, and a check in town for available contracts based on reputation)
- reintroduce the bomb item and DestructionTrigger (mimic DeliveredTrigger)
- reintroduce game saving, let buildings remember if they've been destroyed
