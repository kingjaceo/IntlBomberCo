**The Blessed Loop**
It is 10:30 PM. I spent longer today than I really should have, but I feel like I advanced by leaps and bounds (even though what I've accomplished is incredibly rudimentary). Today I:
- implemented the basic reputation system
- re-implemented bombs and destruction contracts
- caused contracts to escalate in scale based on reputation
- drafted placeholder icon for a small storm bottle.
- COMPLETED THE FIRST SEMBLANCE OF THE MAIN LOOP
On playthrough at the end of the day, I notice:
- item_icons need to free themselves if they're empty / items need to free themselves from player lists
- ItemPanels in the shop need a major overhaul to fall more in line with the new ItemSlot design (should simply be clicked and max is transferred)
- Continue focus on telegraphing: all interactables need some kind of indication 
- Tooltips and designing around tool tips is critical
