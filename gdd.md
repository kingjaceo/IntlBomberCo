## Design Pillars
- Bourgeoning bronze age communism in the midst of a bronze age collapse
- Climate change and extraction
- Reputation, Honor, and Favor
- Living cities

## Vertical Slice
- Basic ship-to-ship combat (eg, storm bottle shoots lightning)
- Basic economy / resource flow (eg, bronze, food/water, wood, which settlements produce/consume, and request from other settlements)
- Settlements remember their state and repair destroyed buildings
- Basic progression w/ a few upgrades (eg, bigger ship, more health, speed)
