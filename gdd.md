# AirshipONE (working title)

## Pitch
AirshipONE is an action-strategy RPG: imagine **FTL** cross **Battle Brothers**. The player controls an airship and its crew in a bronze-age fantasy world, travelling from town to town in their storm-powered airship. The world is falling apart around the player, and the player has to choose how they will help the world fall apart or try in vain to stop it.


## Design Pillars
- **Advancement and Completion:** The player will accumulate reputation in the world, which influences what tasks and upgrades are available to the player. (Bourgeoning bronze age communism; Reputation, Honor, and Favor)
- **Application of an Ability:** The player will have to become well-acquainted with the world and its political actors, learning to fight and/or flee as suits their needs. (Snappy, stressful, important decision making, with room to breathe)
- **Thrill of Danger:** In this world that is falling apart, the player will walk a razor thin edge between survival and defeat. (Climate change and extraction, bronze age collapse, Living cities)


## Audience and Market
The audience is players of strategy and action games, people who like games like FTL or Battle Brothers.

## Core Gameplay
The main loop is: visit a city, interact in the city, take up a new contract, complete the contract, repeat.

### Contracts:
Most of the gameplay motivation comes in the form of contracts settlements and perhaps different factions offer up to achieve their own goals. Here are some examples of contracts:
- _Delivery:_ a settlement wants an agent to deliver surplus materials/products to anyone who will take them or acquire materials in critical shorrtage
- _Destroy Target:_ a settlement or faction wants a specific building or other ship destroyed
- _Explore Area:_ a settlement or faction wants a report of the business of a certain region
- _Defend Settlement:_ an imminent attack leaves a settlement in need of protection


## Controls
The player will control the distribution in storm-power on the ship (how much is allocated to wind vs lightning vs water vs sand), which affects how quickly the ship moves and turns and how much damage the ship can do. The player may also drop certain items, like aid packages and fire bombs, out of their ship's hold on to settlements or even perhaps other ships. The player will also be able to control the flow of time to make better decisions in stressful situations. All of these controls will be keyboard-based.

## Balance and Pacing
The game should proceed in "jumps", which are long enough to make the player appreciate the jump, short enough to keep them entertain, and significant enough to feel game-changing.


## World Design


## Vertical Slice
- Basic ship-to-ship combat (eg, storm bottle shoots lightning)
- Basic economy / resource flow (eg, bronze, food/water, wood, which settlements produce/consume, and request from other settlements)
- Settlements remember their state and repair destroyed buildings
- Basic progression w/ a few upgrades (eg, bigger ship, more health, speed)
